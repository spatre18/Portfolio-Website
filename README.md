            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Sakshi Patre, a second-year IT student at SITRC Nashik. I have a deep passion for technology and web development, and I’m always eager to learn new skills that help me build innovative solutions.

                Currently, I’m focusing on front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to dive deeper into back-end technologies as I progress in my studies. As a student, I love working on hands-on projects, and I enjoy experimenting with different technologies to create interactive and responsive websites.
                
                Through my time at SITRC, I’ve been developing my problem-solving skills and have been part of various group projects, where I’ve learned the importance of collaboration and continuous learning. I’m always exploring new trends in tech and participating in coding challenges to improve my skills.
                
                My goal is to build websites and applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. I’m excited to continue my journey in tech and look forward to collaborating with other developers and learning from the experiences of others.
                
                Feel free to check out my projects below, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to connect or collaborate on exciting projects!</p>
